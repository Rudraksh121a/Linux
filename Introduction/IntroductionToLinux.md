# Linux Introduction

Linux is one of the most influential technologies in modern computing. From smartphones and cloud servers to supercomputers and embedded devices, Linux quietly powers much of the digital world. To understand Linux, it helps to start with a basic concept: the operating system.

## What Is an Operating System?

An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that acts as a bridge between computer hardware and the user.

### Responsibilities of an Operating System
- Providing a user interface (GUI or command line)
- Managing hardware resources such as CPU, memory, and storage
- Enabling applications to run by offering core system services

Without an operating system, hardware is unusable for practical work.

## Types of Operating Systems

Operating systems are designed for different use cases:

- **Desktop Operating Systems** — Personal computers (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Server Operating Systems** — Optimized for stability and networking
- **Mobile Operating Systems** — Smartphones and tablets (Android, iOS)
- **Embedded Operating Systems** — Routers, TVs, IoT devices
- **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)** — Systems requiring precise timing

---

## What Is Linux?

Linux is a **free and open-source operating system kernel**, commonly packaged with tools and software to form complete operating systems known as **Linux distributions**.

### Key Features
- **Free** — No cost to download or use
- **Open Source** — Source code can be viewed, modified, and shared
- **Stable and Secure** — Trusted for servers and critical systems
- **Highly Flexible** — Customizable for desktops, servers, and embedded use

Linux is widely used in **servers, cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and embedded systems**.

## Linux Distributions (Distros)

Linux comes in many distributions, each built for specific needs.

**Examples:**
- Ubuntu
- Fedora
- Debian
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
- Arch Linux

### Typical Workflow
Download ISO → Install → Use GUI or CLI tools

## Why Learn Linux?

- Most servers and cloud platforms run Linux
- Powerful command-line utilities
- Strong security and permission model
- High customizability
- Backed by a global open-source community

## History of Linux

### UNIX (1970s)
Developed at AT&T Bell Labs by **Ken Thompson** and **Dennis Ritchie**. Introduced multitasking and multi-user systems.

### GNU Project (1983)
Started by **Richard Stallman** to build a free UNIX-like OS. Tools existed, but no kernel.

### Birth of Linux (1991)
Created by **Linus Torvalds**.

- v0.01 — Initial release
- v0.02 — Functional kernel combined with GNU tools

This formed a complete operating system.

### Growth Timeline
- 1990s — Slackware, Debian
- 1994 — Linux 1.0
- Late 1990s — Red Hat, SUSE
- 2000s — Server and embedded dominance
- 2007 — Android launched

Today, Linux powers servers, desktops, mobile devices, and all supercomputers.
